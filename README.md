## Introduction
This App started as an inspiration from a design I saw on a youtube video. I expanded on the design and idea.
Creating new designs for different pages and section of this idea. You can find it here [Designs]().
Add new screens to the design. I then now wanted to implement each screen as a frontend project with many moving parts.
