## Introduction
This App started as an inspiration from a design I saw on a youtube video. I expanded on the design and idea.
Creating new designs for different pages and section of this idea. You can find it here [Designs](https://www.figma.com/proto/MvdZQoVN5lkndjSSXnDfYo/Web-App-UI-Design-(Community)?node-id=674-2489&scaling=scale-down&page-id=603%3A300&starting-point-node-id=674%3A2489).
Add new screens to the design. I then now wanted to implement each screen as a frontend project with many moving parts.
As I continue build keep up to date with the latest journey in the story, by following my [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chukwuebuka-ezeocha-2440321a1/)
